
STEPS FOR WHISKER VIDEO ANALYSIS:

1) Invert video colors in ffmpeg and save as .mp4

2) Run "trace" from command prompt to generate .whiskers file (TAKES A LONG TIME)

3) Run "measure" from command prompt to generate .measurements file

4) In matlab, run "traceAnalysis_c" (or whatever is latest version) on .measurements file. Make sure setttings in 'checkTrace' are optimized for current video. (TAKES A LONG TIME)

5) Run 'whiskerangle_bin' to calculate mean, median, variance of traced objects across frames.

6) If want to create a video, run 'whiskerMovie.m' in matlab (TAKES A LONG TIME).

7) To align ntrode and videos, run 'alignNtrodeandVideo'. Set the threshold for the LED syncing signal, and determine the start trials in ntrode and the video.

8) Run whatever analysis you want (e.g. behav_SpikeTimesvsWhiskingbyTrialb).
